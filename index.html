        <h4>Volunteering</h4>
        <h5>Nepal</h5>
        <p>Over October and November, 2016, I took part in a volunteering programme with <a href="https://www.podvolunteer.org/">POD Volunteers</a> to spend time at an orphanage in Pokhara, Nepal to support the street-kids that lived at the centre, and taught at a local school.</p>
        <p>I always look to give back to the community and provide help and support as/when I can. Often it's incredibly difficult to make a valuable change. Unfortunately, solely visiting Nepal and spending time with the young, energetic and enthusiastic children was not enough to change their lives for the better, so I remain in contact with some of the children at the centre, as well as the staff that run it in order to help in any way I can.</p>
        <h5>Thinkspace</h5>
        <p>Coding, in general, is rarely taught in schools and arguably should be a vital part of the nationwide curriculum. Programming teaches students the benefits of logical thinking and encourages them to design and develop their own products, as the world becomes even more engrossed in technology.</p>
        <p>As a result, I set-up a Thinkspace - an area for students to learn how to code, at <a href="http://ucs.org.uk">UCS School for Boys</a>. It was overwhelming to have more students turn up to the first session, than computers in the room!</p>
