This is my personal website - maxkramer.co - written in Grommet.js as an experiment with modern frontend frameworks and component libraries.

To run this application, execute the following commands:

  1. Install NPM modules

    $ npm install

  2. Start the dev server:

    $ npm run dev

To deploy the application, simply merge into master and Netlify will automatically run ```$ npm run dist``` to build the application, and deploy it to their servers.
